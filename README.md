# What Is This?

This repo contains a Ruby script that, when run, will help you learn things!

# How will it help me learn things?

* Clone down the repo and `cd` into the directory
* Run the program like this:

```bash
./cs_on <name of the file>
```

For example:

```bash
./cs_on ruby_inheritance.chicken_eser
```

This will output a series of code examples to the terminal. Your job is to just *look at it*. Try to take it in and reason about what the code is doing. You might not understand the technical ins-and-outs of the code you're shown. The point is for you to expose yourself to it, think about, and try to puzzle about what the code does conceptually.

When you feel you have a general sense of what the code in the example does, hit `enter` for the next example.

### Note

It's super important you don't research anything! You're working on your ability to reason about code.
 It should be progressive, so the previous example should set you up for the next one.
